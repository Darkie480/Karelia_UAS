## Project description
This project was created as part of the Web Ohjelmointi 1 course.  
The task involved building a simple phonebook webpage that connects to a teacher-provided server.  
The application allows the user to:
- View a list of saved names and phone numbers.
- Add new entries.
- Edit and delete entries.

## How to run
1. Download or clone this project from GitHub.
2. Ensure that the teacher-provided server is running locally (instructions for installation and startup are located in "server" folder, file named "asennus_ja_kaynnistys.txt", guidance is in Finnish).
3. Open `index.html` from the client folder in your browser.
4. Use the interface to view and manage phonebook entries.
> **Note:** that without the server in the background you can not add, edit, delete or browse the files.
